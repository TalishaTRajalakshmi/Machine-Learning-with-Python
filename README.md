**Data Collection and Exploration:**

A comprehensive dataset capturing various aspects of students' academic and personal backgrounds was gathered.
Features included marital status, course choice, previous qualifications, grades, and socio-economic indicators.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics.

**Preprocessing and Modeling:**

The dataset was preprocessed to prepare it for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Given the binary nature of the target variable (graduate or dropout), several classification algorithms were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, xgboost, and MLP Classifier.


**Model Selection and Evaluation:**

Logistic Regression was chosen as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability, achieving an accuracy of approximately 89%.
Decision Trees were identified as a suitable algorithm due to their versatility in handling various datasets without requiring specific data distributions. They are less sensitive to outliers and can be easily adjusted and retrained as the dataset evolves.

**Advantages of Decision Trees:**

Decision Trees were highlighted for their practical implementation, scalability, and interpretability.
Their ability to handle complex, diverse datasets with features like socio-economic indicators and academic performance was emphasized.
The model's performance metrics (best score: 92.93%, accuracy: 83.99%) showcased its robustness in capturing non-linear relationships and critical thresholds affecting student outcomes.

**Conclusion:**

The Decision Tree algorithm was recommended as the preferred choice for predicting student graduation or dropout rates in educational settings.
Its simplicity, interpretability, and robustness to outliers make it accessible and effective for stakeholders, aiding in decision-making and intervention strategies.
